ORDER & TRACKING

You will get an Order Confirmation email after placing your purchase, which will confirm your Order # and other purchase information. By midnight on the same day that you placed your order, you can cancel it or update your shipping details. Your order will be processed for stocking, packaging, and shipping after 6 hours, which typically takes 1 – 3 business days.

We will send you a Shipping Update email with your tracking number as soon as your order ships. Click on the linked link to track your package. For the first couple of days, after you receive your Shipping Update email, tracking information might not be accessible. The time between package scans may be several days. We can tell you that this is typical and will not affect your delivery as planned.

DELIVERY TIME
